# Contributions

Every member has to complete at least 2 meaningful tasks per week, where a
single development task should have a granularity of 0.5-1 day. The completed
tasks have to be shown in the weekly TA meetings. You have one "Joker" to miss
one weekly TA meeting and another "Joker" to once skip continuous progress over
the remaining weeks of the course. Please note that you cannot make up for
"missed" continuous progress, but you can "work ahead" by completing twice the
amount of work in one week to skip progress on a subsequent week without using
your "Joker". Please communicate your planning **ahead of time**.

Note: If a team member fails to show continuous progress after using their
Joker, they will individually fail the overall course (unless there is a valid
reason).

**You MUST**:

- Have two meaningful contributions per week.

**You CAN**:

- Have more than one commit per contribution.
- Have more than two contributions per week.
- Link issues to contributions descriptions for better traceability.

**You CANNOT**:

- Link the same commit more than once.
- Use a commit authored by another GitHub user.

As users click 'I am Ready,' the UI updates in real time to show who is ready and who is not.

It should check four things: If it is a valid URL, if it is a YouTube link then it should check if it is a valid one, if the link is less than 512 characters (this should be enough for most) and if the field is empty. Added a new button when video fails to load in lobby which open the link in new tab.] | [This prevents errors in the lobby or UI bugs for example beforehand. It allows a smooth experience when creating Watchparties. Also now it shows more clearly that if a video is private or there is copyright issues that one can open the link in a new tab while still using the lobby functionalities like the chat and 'I am ready' button.] |

The lobby is still useful in this case and in general one is informed about if someone is not ready.] |
