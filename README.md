## Introduction

Flicks & Friends üéâ is your go-to platform for discovering, organizing, and enjoying movies and TV shows with friends. Whether you‚Äôre searching for new content, creating watch parties, or sharing recommendations, this app makes it easy to stay connected and entertained. Browse trending titles, manage watchlists, rate and review films, and experience synchronized watch parties‚Äîall in one place.

Driven by the increasing desire for community engagement and shared entertainment experiences, the app enables users to register, search titles via integrated APIs, rate and review what they watch, and organize virtual watch parties with friends, all from a single platform. Flicks & Friends aims to deliver a user-centric and collaborative experience.

Our primary motivation for choosing to work on this project is the lack of trustworthy recommendations that we see in the market ‚Äì in contrast, the customers of Flicks & Friends will be able to rely upon the recommendations of their own friends rather than the recommendations of someone they don‚Äôt know about.

## High-Level Components

The Watchparty component of our frontend enables users to create and manage watch parties üçø, invite friends, and track invitation responses. The central class for this functionality is <a href="app/watchparty/page.tsx" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">WatchpartyPage</a>.

#### Key Features:

- Handles the creation of new watch parties, displays existing ones, and allows users to invite friends.

#### State Management:

- `watchparties`: Stores the list of fetched watch parties.
- `username`, `userIdStr`: Retrieved from session storage to identify the current user.
- `form`: Manages the form state for creating new watch parties.
- `inviteModalVisible`: Controls the visibility of the invite friends modal.
- `selectedWatchPartyId`: Stores the ID of the watch party selected for inviting friends.

#### Functions:

- `onFinish`: Handles the submission of the "Create Watchparty" form. It validates the input, converts the time to UTC, and sends a request to the backend API to create the watch party.
- `disabledDate`, `disabledTime`: Functions to disable past dates and times in the form's date and time pickers, ensuring that watch parties are scheduled for the future.
- `handleInviteClick`, `closeInviteModal`: Functions to show and close the InviteFriendsModal.
- `fetchData`: Fetches watch parties organized by the user and watch parties the user is invited to.

### InviteFriendsModal Component

This component is responsible for inviting friends to a selected watch party. It is opened when the user clicks the "Invite Friends" button for a specific watch party.

- Imported as `InviteFriendsModal`
- Takes `watchPartyId`, `visible`, and `onClose` as props.
- Displays a list of friends and sends invitations to the backend.

### InviteResponsesPolling Component

This component is responsible for polling for responses to invitations for watch parties created by the current user.

- Imported as `InviteResponsesPolling`
- Takes `watchParties` as a prop.
- Fetches the responses from invited users and displays them.

### UI Elements

This component uses a combination of state management, API calls, and UI elements to provide a functional interface for managing watch parties.

- **Ant Design components used**:
  - `Form`
  - `Input`
  - `Button`
  - `Card`
  - `Table`
  - `DatePicker`
  - `TimePicker`
